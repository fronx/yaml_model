YamlModel
=========

Declare your own YAML-based models by inheriting from YamlModel::Base.

Example
=======

class Book < YamlModel::Base
  fields :title, :author, :content
end

Book.setup  # creates the data file RAILS_ROOT/data/book.yml
Book.all    # returns all records from book.yml

book = Book.first
puts book.title
puts book.author
puts book.content
